# Castle Defenders

A fun little tower defense game I'm working on where you... defend the castle. Obviously
(My art sucks by the way)

I'm assumimng you know how to run the game. If not, wait for a release OR when the game starts development go to: maneesh593.github.io/castledefenders/ and play it there

There are .gitkeep files because Git doesn't keep track of folders that dont have atleast 1 file in them
